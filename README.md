# Dr-Mario-Cpp

A game written in C++ based on the original Dr Mario for the NES.
I based parts of the design on a project I previously did in 
Racket, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ctman96/Dr-Mario-Racket)

## Development

Requires the following developer libraries

* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) 
* [SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) 
* [SDL2_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) 

You will also require [Python](https://www.python.org/) in order to run the script used to embed resources.

The source code includes files for building via CMake.
